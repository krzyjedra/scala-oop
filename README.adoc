= Calendar class
:numbered:
:toc: preamble
:toc-title: Table of contents

App can have days with tasks assigned.
The application doesn't allow the user to add overlapping (happening at the same time) tasks.
Tasks can be recurring.

== Dependencies

You are going to need the following:

* Java 8+
* Scala 2.13+

== How to run

* Clone the repository and run.

----
git clone
https://github.com/krzyjedra/scala-oop.git
----

== Example of usage

You can check such input:

----
Calendar(365).dayScheduler("bieganie", 5)
----

Also don't hesitate to check more in tests.

== Troubleshooting

* If ScalaTest is not working please check your `build.sbt` file

libraryDependencies += "org.scalactic" %% "scalactic" % "3.2.12"

libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.2.12" % "test"

* Please remember that calendar can't have more days than 365 or less than 1.
* Please remember that you can't assign two tasks one by one to single day.
In such scenario app will only take first input record.
